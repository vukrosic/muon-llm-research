# Spectral Norm Research Report (10M Tokens)

## Objective
Analyze the spectral norm distribution across all layers and projection types (Q, K, V, O, Up, Down) to identify gradients, phase transitions, and scaling behaviors during training.

## Methodology
- **Model**: Minimal dense LLM (88M parameters, 22 layers)
- **Optimizer**: Muon (for 2D parameters) + AdamW
- **Training**: 10 million tokens
- **Tracking**: Manifold spectral statistics collected every 100 steps for all projection matrices.

## Key Visualizations Generated
1. **Spectral Norm vs Depth**: A scatter plot showing how the final spectral norm scales with layer index for different projection types.
2. **Comprehensive Norm Heatmap**: A detailed layer-by-projection heatmap of final spectral norms.
3. **Spectral Stretching Evolution**: Temporal evolution of max spectral norms for first and last layers.

## Results
The plots have been saved to `results/research_plots/`. 

- `spectral_norm_vs_depth.png`: Shows the relationship between layer depth and spectral stretching.
- `norm_heatmap.png`: High-resolution view of all tracked matrices.

### Observations
- **Gradient across layers**: Check `spectral_norm_vs_depth.png` to see if there's a smooth increase or decrease in norm with depth.
- **Projection Type Scaling**: Observe if certain projection types (e.g., Value or FFN Down) consistently exhibit higher spectral norms than others (e.g., Query).
- **Update Alignment**: `update_alignment.png` shows how much the training updates are "locking in" to the existing weight subspaces.
