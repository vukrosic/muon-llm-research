# Experiment 00: Dry Run

Verified logging works. 2000 steps.
This dry run ensures that:
1. Per-layer, per-projection metrics are correctly captured.
2. Metrics are saved in JSONL format.
3. Token-based checkpoints (if any milestone reached) are saved.
4. The directory structure follows the new research workflow.
